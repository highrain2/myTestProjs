Welcome to the Data Science Boot Camp 2019!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary
This 2-week boot camp is for aspiring data scientists. We will take each student from an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Python, to the state-of-the-art in Deep Learning.  Each section is organized with 30% lecture + 70% hands-on training.  Each student will develop a uniquely tailored Capstone Project and present it at the end of the course.
